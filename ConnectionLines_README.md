#Connection Lines
a feature for the ViaProMa project
by Julian Staab, Emilie Hastrup-Kiil and Miriam Kempter
supervised by Ralf Klamma and Benedikt Hensen.

##Description:
A tool with which it is possible to connect 3D objects like issues and visualisations using lines. 
These are customisable in size or color and the feature is integrated into the ViaProMa project.
The main purpose of this feature is the visualisation of the dependencies and connections in
project development applications.

##How to use this feature:
First you need to enter the Connection Lines menu by clicking the "Connection Lines" button in the Main Menu.
To create a line, first press "Enter Line Draw" and then select two issues or visualizations.
You can select one of six colors and one of two line widths for your line.
By pressing "Draw Line" the connection line is created.
To delete, you can either use "Delete All Lines" to delete all lines or press "Enter Single Delete" to activate the delete mode, which works like creating lines.

###Test
To test this feature, there is a testscene in the Assets/Tests/Verbindungslinien folder where the functionality of the connection lines can be tried out and experimented with.
