# Changelog

This document keeps track of the changes between versions of the toolkit.

## 1.2.1 (2020-12-10)

### Fixed
- Fixed a compilation error that was caused by the OpenID Connect module when building with IL2CPP on other platforms than UWP

### Changed
- Added an instance of the app console to the OpenID Connect sample scene.
  This way, the console output with the login result can be seen in compiled applications.

## 1.2.0 (2020-12-07)

### Added
- In-application console which can show log outputs in deployed applications
- Json utilitiy to serialize and deserialize arrays at root level
- Unity adapter classes
  - Interfaces for text displays, activatable objects, UI rectangles and scroll views
  - Adapter for text UI (TextMesh, TextMeshPro and TextMeshProUGUI)
  - Adapter for GameObject, RectTransform, ScrollRect
- Experimental notification system

### Changed
- Sample scenes can now be accessed with the Unity Package UI (with Unity Package Manager 2.0 in Unity 2019.1 or later)
- Documentation moved to [GitHub pages](https://rwth-acis.github.io/i5-Toolkit-for-Unity)

## 1.1.0 (2020-08-24)

### Added
- Added OpenID Connect client implementation as a login solution for the editor, standalone and UWP.
- Added a solution to mark objects as persistent so that they are not unloaded on scene changes.
- Added UI operator which can simulate user interactions with the UI.
  This is useful for creating system tests where the user interaction should be automated.

### Changed
- Service Manager is not a MonoBehaviour anymore.
- Service bootstrappers can now be standalone components that do not depend on the existence of a service manager in the scene.
- WebResponses now provide the entire text of the response body in case of an error.

### Update Guide
- The IService interface now requires a IServiceManager in the Initialize method.
  To update, just replace `Initialize(ServiceManager owner)` with `Initialize(IServiceManager owner)` in your services.
- Service Manager is not a MonoBehaviour anymore.
  If you added the Service Manager to a scene in the editor, just remove the component.
- Bootstrappers now have to inherit from `BaseServiceBootstrapper` instead of `IServiceBootstrapper`.
  To update, change the inheritance and implement the methods `RegisterServices()` and `UnRegisterServices()` in your bootstrappers.
  Since the Service Manager is not a MonoBehaviour anymore, the bootstrapper component can now be placed anywhere in the scene.
