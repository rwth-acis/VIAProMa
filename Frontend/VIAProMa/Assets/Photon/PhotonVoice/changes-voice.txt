Photon Voice 2 Change Log

v2.22.3 (December 10th, 2020)
   PUN2: v2.26 (1bb4b17)
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 5901
   CHANGED: skipping linking incoming remote streams with codec other than opus.

v2.22.2 (December 2nd, 2020)
   PUN2: v2.25.1 (cc3faf8)
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 5901
   FIXED: [PhotonVoiceApi macOS, iOS] AudioInPusher: 'pushCallback' null check added in native callback to avoid NullReferenceException if SetCallback() gets called later than native input starts to produce samples.
   FIXED: [PhotonVoiceApi Windows] WindowsAudioInPusher.SetCallback(): 'pushCallback' is initialized last to make sure that null check in native callback guards all members.

v2.22.1 (November 29th, 2020)
   PUN2: v2.24 (b503239)
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 5897
   FIXED: broken leftover code after renaming in Speaker.
   FIXED: [>=Unity 2019.1] incorrect method name in UiExtensions : InputField.SetTextWithoutNotify instead of InputField.SetValueWithoutNotify.
   FIXED: more CS649 warnings.
   CHANGED: fields used in Unity 2019.1 or higher wrapped in #ifdef.
   CHANGED: moved macOS voice libs under same folder "Assets\Photon\PhotonVoice\PhotonVoiceLibs\OSX".
   ADDED: PhotonVoiceNetwork private flags to support manual explicit voice client connect calls (e.g. ConnectUsingSettings).
   CHANGED: VoiceLogger timestamp format as an attempt to fix exception in Thai calendar/culture.
   REMOVED: minor, cleanup unused using in PhotonVoiceNetwork.

v2.22 (November 20th, 2020)
   PUN2: v2.23 (9c75048)
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 5856
   FIXED: Speaker.StartPlayback should fail if Speaker is not enabled/active and PlaybackOnlyWhenEnabled is used.
   ADDED: [BREAKING] PhotonVoiceNetwork.UsePunAuthValues (default true): if used Photon Voice client will use the same AuthValues as PUN client. AuthMode and EncrytionMode are applied also now.
   ADDED: PlaybackDelaySettings which makes old PlayDelayMs/GlobalPlaybackDelay obsolete. Playback delay is now finetuned using 3 parameters. This should help fix the "high pitch" issue when player tries to catch up and does resampling.
   ADDED: Speaker.playbackExplicitlyStopped flag to make sure Speaker playback does not auto start again when not needed.
   CHANGED: NativeAndroidMicrophoneSettings to struct.
   ADDED: DisallowMultipleComponent attribute to Speaker, Recorder and WebRtcAudioDsp.
   ADDED: minor check to detect and log case where PUN & Voice clients are both connected to MasterServer.
   ADDED: [DemoVoiceUI] new AudioTone factory source to test playback delay.
   ADDED: [DemoVoiceUI] new playback delay settings.

v2.21 (September 8th, 2020)
   PUN2: v2.22 (9b9f51f5)
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 5731
   CHANGED: DemoVoiceUI improved with more features, more insights and control over voice streams.
   CHANGED: some fields are now serialized no matter the platform to avoid unnecessary VCS changes when switching platforms.
   FIXED: IgnoreGlobalLogLevel taken into consideration when setting log level for Recorder or Speaker.
   CHANGED: Recorder.ReactOnSystemChanges ignored when Photon microphone type is used on Android or iOS as this is handled internally automatically via native plugins for the respective platforms.
   FIXED: 649 warnings for private SerializedFields not initialized.
   ADDED: Recorder.ResetLocalAudio to reset audio session and parameters locally to fix broken recording due to system configuration modifications or audio interruptions or audio routing changes. 
   CHANGED: Recorder.ResetLocalAudio is now used internally instead of or before Recorder.RestartRecording to try to automatically recover or resume recording.
   CHANGED: moved StopRecordingWhenPaused check in outer scope
   ADDED: Recorder.UseMicrophoneTypeFallback to optionally disable microphone type fallback in case of failures with initial type from Unity to Photon when applicable (and vice versa).
   FIXED: Recorder.subscribedToSystemChangesX flags are now properly reset when unsubscribed from callbacks.
   FIXED: when system callbacks fire, RequiresRestart is set only when mic device in use is no longer valid and do not it is not used as a check for this.
   ADDED: WebRtcAudioDsp.AecHighPass to be used with WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC.
   ADDED: WebRtcAudioDsp.AgcCompressionGain to be used with WebRtcAudioDsp.AGC, values are from 0 to 99. Default is 9.
   ADDED: checks & error logs when trying to assign Speaker.Actor for linked speakers.
   ADDED: [Experimental] WebRtcAudioDsp.ForceNormalAecInMobile to use regular non-mobile WebRTC AEC on Android or iOS.
   CHANGED: [PhotonVoiceApi] Android and iOS native audio input plugins updated to better handle routing changes, interruptions and make use of hardware audio processing features.

v2.20 (August 14th, 2020)
   PUN2: v2.20.2 (24c76182)
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 5698
   CHANGED: delayed Speaker initialization until speaker is linked (once/the first time). This was necessary for PlayStation to be able to set UserID before playback start, but we chose to apply to all platforms.
   ADDED: [Logging] info log entries when subscribing and unsubscribing from audio config/device changes callbacks.
   FIXED: [PlayStation] Speaker.PlayStationUserID set before Speaker initialization. This fix is good unlike previous ones.
   FIXED: [Editor only] Recorder editor exception in WebGL context. UnityMicrophone.devices (also UnityMicrophone.IsRecording) now returns a value instead of thrown NotImplementedException.
   ADDED: [Experimental] Recorder.UseOnAudioFilterRead to make use of Unity's audio processing chain.

   CHANGED: Android plugin for native microphone input updated to allow setting effects AEC, AGC and NS optionally & separately.
   ADDED: Native Android Microphone Settings when Photon mic type is used.
   ADDED: [Editor only] Best Region Box from PUN's ServerSettings to VoiceConnection's custom editor
   REMOVED: best region logic from VoiceConnection as we rely on LoadBalancingClient for this.
   CHANGED: VoiceConnection.ConnectUsingSettings relies on LoadBalancingClient's ConnectUsingSettings.
   FIXED: PhotonVoice connects to the same region as PUN when the integration is used.
   FIXED: Applied 'static' custom editor views when component is attached to prefab.

   CHANGED: [WebRtcAudioDsp] recording is restarted if WebRtcAudioDsp is added after recording is started.
   CHANGED: [WebRtcAudioDsp] dispose old processor if any before starting new one.
   CHANGED: [WebRtcAudioDsp] AEC Mobile obsolete: it should be automatically set when a mobile platform (Android or iOS) is detected.
